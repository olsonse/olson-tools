/*
 * $Log: Distribution.h,v $
 * Revision 1.3  2005/05/12 04:27:29  olsonse
 * Fixed to for Intel 8.1 compilers.
 * Found (using intel compiler) and fixed an array overflow in BField::potential.
 * Didn't find it earlier because the array is on the stack for the function.
 *
 * Added fmacros.h file to simplify mixing fortran code with others.
 * Added alias function names for Fortran interoperability.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/04/19 17:23:21  olsonse
 * Added new RKIntegrator wrapper class to allow for generic integration
 * templates.
 *
 * Also added trapfe library to help with trapping floating point exceptions.
 *
 * Fixed Distribution inverter finally (hopefull).  It no longer truncates the
 * distribution or reads from bogus memory.
 *
 * Added rk2 integrator (modified Euler) to rk.F.
 *
 * Various other fixes.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/01/14 14:09:31  olsonse
 * Fixed documentation on memory.h, msh.h, options.h.
 * Moved new files Distribution.[hC] listutil.h readData.h from dsmc code.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2005/01/08 04:57:25  olsonse
 * Initial CVS import (finally).
